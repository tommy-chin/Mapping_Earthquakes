# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
A data visualization of major earthquakes during a week's time was requested by the Disaster Reporting Network. The original visualization created including a street map overlay as well as a satellite map overlay. The locations of the earthquake were interactive pop-ups on these maps in which one could see the magnitude and the locations of occurrence. These locations were also colored in relations to the magnitudes of the earthquakes. Two colleagues, Basil and Sadhana, would then request that the visualization include another map overlay and that the tectonic plates' locations were drawn on the map. It was also requested that there be an option to toggle only the earthquakes that had a magnitude greater than 4.5.
